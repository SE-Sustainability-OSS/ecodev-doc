After a french engineering school <a href=https://www.ensta-paris.fr/ class="external-link" target="_blank">(ENSTA)</a> and an additionnal Master in theoretical particle physics at <a href=https://www.polytechnique.edu/ class="external-link" target="_blank"> Ecole Polytechnique</a>  and <a href=https://www.phys.ens.fr/fr/formations/m2-icfp class="external-link" target="_blank">ENS Ulm Paris</a>, <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-epelbaum-64b09625/ class="external-link" target="_blank">Thomas</a> did a Phd at <a href=https://www.ipht.fr/ class="external-link" target="_blank"> CEA Saclay</a> and a postdoc at <a href=https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/research/thep.html class="external-link" target="_blank">McGill University</a> working on <a href=https://www.theses.fr/2014PA066103 class="external-link" target="_blank">Quantum Chromodynamics</a> .   

Wanting to have a more direct impact on society, he started to study Data Science in the summer of 2015, and switched professionaly in the beginning of 2016.

He then spent 6 years in Data Science, Reasearch science,  Lead ML R&D Engineer in 3 different SME/startups (mediamobile, Shift Technology (the 13th french unicorn) and Collective Thinking. 

Among other things, he released during his pure ML time a <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01412 class="external-link" target="_blank">white book on deep learning</a> in 2017 (1.4K stars on <a href=https://github.com/tomepel/Technical_Book_DL class="external-link" target="_blank">Github</a> )

Glancing more on more on the pure devs aspects year after year, Thomas joined EcoAct in 2022 as a senior python developer, and is now head of the python developments.  

At EcoAct, he developed from scratch more than 30 web app -- most small of course, but some also large like the Climate Risk Platform -- and helped other developers released another ten more applications. All that would not have been possible without <a href=https://scolvin.com/ class="external-link" target="_blank">Tiangolo</a>, <a href=https://github.com/tiangolo class="external-link" target="_blank">Samuel Covin</a> (that Thomas thanks again), and the **ecodev** project!

At a personal level, Thomas likes (a lot :) ) reading on economy, philosophy, sociology and biology, spending time in the Alpes (every season), try a new collaborative board game, or play a competitive one. He is quite good at  <a href=hhttps://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/126792/myrmes class="external-link" target="_blank">Myrmes</a>   (best board game ever ðŸ˜‹)
