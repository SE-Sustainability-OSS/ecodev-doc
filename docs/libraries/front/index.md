# EcoDev-Front

This small library includes Dash front-end components to facilitate the construction of a <a href=https://dash.plotly.com/ class="external-link" target="_blank">Dash</a> app.

It is a very downgraded (let's say reduced and opinionated to avoid being too self-critical ðŸ¤£) version of 
<a href=https://www.dash-mantine-components.com/ class="external-link" target="_blank">Dash Mantine Components</a> (DMC), itself a simplified version of the React
<a href=https://mantine.dev/ class="external-link" target="_blank">Mantine</a> library (shoulder of giants to the power of two ðŸ˜…).

We decided to release it nevertheless as DMC has introduced major breaking changes in the past (changing some of its attribute arguments), and we did not want to spend
our lives editing 50+ codebases everytime this happens. 

Plus some of the (again, opinionated) options taken here have simplified (and drastically speed up) the creation of new applications for us, to the point where the limiting
factor when developing (sometimes not so) simple application dashboard is rarely if ever the frontend. 

If this is rings a bell for you, then go on reading the different documentation pages ðŸ˜Š! They are split into two groups

- Components: real component (a graph, a text...)
- Layouts: helper to create simple yet beautiful pages.
